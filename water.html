            <h1 class="questions">What is recycling water?</h1>

            <p>Before we can answer this question, we must first answer another one:
                <br> What is <b>recycling</b>?
                <div class="list">
                    <b>Recycle</b> means:
                    <ul>
                        <li>to recover useful materials from garbage or waste </li>
                        <li>to extract and reuse</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                This term is usually applied to glass bottles, newspapers and aluminum cans but water can be recycled as well! Water recycling is the process of treating wastewater and reusing it for beneficial purpouses such as irrigation, industrial processes, replenishing ground water basins and much more. Recycling water also offers financial and resource savings.

            <h1 class="questions">How can recycling water benefit us?</h1>
            <p>
                If it is adequately treated, recycled water can satisfy most water demands. 
				There are different ways in which water can be treated. 
				If there is a higher chance of human exposure to the water, more treatment is required. 
				Just like any other water source, if it is not properly treated, health problems may 
				arise from drinking or being exposed to the recycled water if it contains 
				disease-causing organisms or other contaminants. 
				Water treatment may be costly but it is really worth it!

            <h1 class="questions">How is water treated?</h1>
            <p>
                For many types of reuse applications water must pass through numerous sewage treatement process steps before it can be used. Steps might inclide primary settling, biological treatment and desinfection. There are several technologies to trеat wastewater for reuse. A combination of these technologies can meet strict standarts and make sure that the processed water is hygenically safe.

                <div class="list">
                    Some of the typical technologies include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ozonation</li>
                        <li>Ultrafiltration</li>
                        <li>Forward osmosis</li>
                        <li>Reverse osmosis</li>
                        <li>Advanced oxidation</li>

<center><h1 class="questions">Here are some facts about recycling from around the globe</h1></center>

<ul class="list2">
  <li>Israel recycles 80 percent of its sewage, using much of it for irrigation.</li>
  <li>It is estimated that reuse of all the wastewater we discharge to the oceans and estuaries would increase the water available to U.S. municipalities by about 6 percent.</li>
  <li>Globally, around 20 million ha of land are irrigated with wastewater, and this is likely to increase markedly during the next few decades as water stress intensifies. (2007)</li>
  <li>95% of water that enters the home goes down the drain daily.</li>
  <li>Of the 32 billion gallons of wastewater discharged every day, 12 billion gallons is discharged into oceans and estuaries.</li>
  <li>Recycled water costs about $1,100 an acre-foot to produce, about half the cost of desalinating ocean water.</li>
  <li>Less than three-tenths of 1 percent of total water use across the United States involves recycling.</li>
  <li>Singapore’s wastewater recycling plant uses advanced membrane techniques to produce water that is clean enough to be used for the electronics industry and be bottled as drinking water.</li>
  <li>Florida is a national leader in water reuse. Approximately 719 million gallons per day of reclaimed water was reused for beneficial purposes in 2013.</li>
  <li>According to the University of Arizona’s Water Resources Research Center, between 60 and 65 percent of the water that goes down a home’s drain has the potential to be reused.</li>
</ul>
