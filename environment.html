                    <ul>
                        <li class="tips">You can take part in volunteer activities concerning water like cleaning streams or beaches.</li>
                        <li class="tips">Replace toxic chemicals in your house, that usually go down the drain, with non-toxic ones. The more safe products people use, the fewer unhealthy chemicals end up in our waters.</li>
						<li class="tips">Recycle and dispose of trash in proper ways. Things that aren’t biodegradable—that don’t break down naturally by themselves—can wind up littering beaches and waters.</li>
						<li class="tips">Never pour chemicals down sinks and toilets. Chemicals that we use in our homes every day—paint, cleaning sprays, weed killer, bug killer and many others—should never end up in our water.</li>
						<li class="tips">If you have a garden or something else that reqires water, collect rain water and use it instead of clean potable water </li>

                        <li class="tips">Conserve energy. Switch off fans and lights when you are going out. A large number of fossil fuels are burnt to produce electricity.</li>
						<li class="tips">Understand the concept of Reuse, Reduce and Recycle. Do not throw away items that are of no use to you. In-fact reuse them for some other purpose.</li>
						<li class="tips">Emphasis on clean energy sources. Clean energy technologies like solar, wind and geothermal are on high these days.</li>
						<li class="tips">Use enery efficient devices. CFL lights consume less electricity. They live longer, consume less electricity, lower electricity bills and also help you to reduce pollution by consuming less energy.</li>
