                <p>
                    In short, recycling air doesn't really mean recycling air 
					as a whole but extracting harmful substances from the air. 
					Since air is such a vital resource for us, experts from all 
					around the world have been trying to find a way to rid the 
					atmosphere of pollution. Major cities like Beijing and Delhi, 
					among others, have a very high AQI (air quality index), which 
					means their air is very polluted. So polluted in fact people 
					have to wear masks! These cities these cities are a few in number, 
					but in the course of time, if we do not change our lifestyle, 
					this number will increase drastically. What are the dangers of 
					polluted air, what is causing all of this pollution and how are 
					people dealing with it?

                <p>
                    Most simply put, air pollutants are things that pollute air. 
					When presented with the words "air pollution", most poeple 
					thinks of factories and cars. It is true that cars and factories 
					pollute the air the most, but there are other things that do that 
					as well. For example indoor air pollution, agricultural activities 
					and minging operations. Of course, the burning of fossil fuels is 
					still a really big problem too. These activities all play a big part 
					in our daily lives so it is important to find a way in which we don't 
					cause as much pollution while still maintaining our quality of living.

                    Air pollution can have disastrous effects.

                        Here are some of them:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Respiratory and heart problems-The effects of air pollution are known create several respiratory and heart conditions, including Cancer.</li>
                            <li>Global warming-Increased temperatures worldwide, increase in sea levels and melting of ice and icebergs have already been signaled.</li>
                            <li>Acid rain-Rain becomes acidic when it fuses with gasses from burning fossil fuels</li>
                            <li>Eutrophication-a condition where nitrogen gets developed on the seaâ€™s surface and turns itself into algae, affecting fish, plants and animal species.</li>
                            <li>Effect on wildlife-Toxic chemicals in the air can force species to move to a new place and change their habitat.</li>
                            <li>Depletion of the ozone layer-As the ozone layer will go thin, it will emit harmful rays back on earth and can cause skin and eye related problems.</li>

                Several attempts are being made worldwide on a personal, industrial and 
				governmental levels to curb the intensity at which air pollution is rising 
				and regain a balance as far as the proportions of the foundation gases are
